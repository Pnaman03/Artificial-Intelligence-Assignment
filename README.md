# Artificial intelligence Assignment

## Assignment 1 : 8 queen problem using UCS.

Implemented using queue and pushing childs and exploring again in the order of push i.e BFS since cost is same so this is UCS only.

## Assignment 2 : 8 Queen problem using A-star algoritm

8 Queen problem using A-star algoritm with suitable huristic function.(implemented using priority queue with priority as sum of g(n) and h(n))

**Heuristic Function** : No. of feasible posution/blocks in current state

## Assignment 3 : Group n students in 3 groups so that the diversity(i.e absolute differnce of marks) in each group is minimum.

**Chromosome :** array of group integer : first 3 integer represents group representative of their group and 4th intger is the fitness value of that chromosome.\
**Population size :** 50 chromosomes\
**selection and crossover :** selecting two parent by tournament selection and crossing using a random cross over point.\
**mutation :** selecting random y individuals from the cross over population and mutating or changing a single rand group representavi to increase diversity and then replacing old popul. by the new generated and mutated population.\
