# Artificial intelligence Assignment

Assignment 1 :
8 queen problem using UCS.
(implementing using queue and pushing childs and exploring again in the order of push i.e BFS since cost is same so this is UCS only) 

Assignment 2 :
8 Queen problem using A-star algoritm with suitable huristic function.(implemented using priority queue with priority as sum of g(n) and h(n))
Heuristic Function : No. of feasible posution/blocks in current state
